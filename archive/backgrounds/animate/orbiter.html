      not 100% clear why the ease transition isn't working. it's fine with the
      bounce - maybe something about the calculations. Is there a way to smooth
      it, or do I need to make the increments into 1 degree with javascript?
      <div class="ball2 core"></div>

    <div class="box2">
      using the "translate" animation is definitely smoother, but if you look closely, you can see that the circle's approximate with the number of anchor points this currently uses.  It looks smoother than it did with half as many, so I could absolutely do it 1 degree at a time, but I'd need a tool to generate that css, since there's no way I do it by hand.

      ok, building it reveals the secret sauce is that it's a straight rotation,
      but the origin is outside of the object, so it orbits that.

Ok, next, let's set up an LI so that we can apply Nth and animation delay to do several of these? <br>
Ok, this works, though it reveals I'm not quite centering things where I think I am. also, the delay on start is a little odd - I suspect there's a way to start at the end or middle?     <div class="ball2 core"></div>
<div class="core"></div>
      <ul class="orbitlist orbit1">

        <li><div class="ball2 orbit"></li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="box2">
     Managed to get past the lagged start by using negative animation delay, which definitely seems like a good trick.     <div class="ball2 core"></div>

Weird rotation is almost certainly about the center point.  Playing around with visualizing that.

<div class="box2">
I broke one of the earlier ones, but in doing so made it obvious that the rotation point was too far to the left.  Fiddling with that (and with an 8px centerpoint)  <br>
so the  trick here is that the balls rotation is such that at 180 degrees it's FLIPPED,  This would be more obvious with squares, so maybe I'll try that.

Trying Squares.  Well, crap, that hypothesis was wrong.  Fiddling more

Ok, that's curious.  The trick was putting a POSITIVE value in the OH GOD I'M AN IDIOT - Positive Y value is down from top - I was putting in a negative value.       <div class="ring core"></div>
